# GMIT Timetable App

This is an Timetable application designed and built for the students and staff members for GMIT Galway. Upon registering and logging into the app, the main page displays an option to select any course in GMIT. We designed this application to provide easier access for students and staff to view their timetables while providing them push notifications to alert users before their next class and to alert them of what class they have and where it is being held.
